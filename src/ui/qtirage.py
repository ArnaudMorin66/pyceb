class QTirage(CebTirage, ObservableBase):
    """
    Represents a specialized drawable object in a user interface, inheriting
    behaviors from CebTirage and ObservableBase.

    The QTirage class encapsulates drawing operations and status handling
    within a graphical application. It extends CebTirage functionality by
    adding observable pattern support through ObservableBase. This class
    also manages a duration attribute that records the time taken by
    certain operations, typically used for performance monitoring. The
    class provides methods for solving a problem and clearing the state,
    with notifications sent to observers when these operations occur.

    Attributes:
        _duree: An integer representing the duration of an operation.

    Parameters:
        parent: Optional; The parent widget, if any, to which this object belongs.

        it takes to execute the 'solve' method from the superclass, restores the cursor
        once finished, and notifies observers of the computation status. The duration
        is stored in the '_duree' attribute for later reference.

        the _duree attribute to zero and then calls the _notify method to signal any changes
        in the objectâ€™s state using the result from the superclass clear method.
